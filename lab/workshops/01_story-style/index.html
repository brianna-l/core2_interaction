        1. On a sunny afternoon, I turned on the computer and planned to play my favorite game at the time on the 4399 platform.
        2. Not long after, my mom came into the room and stopped me, saying that I already used up the 30 minutes game time for the week.
        3. I was good at hiding my idea, I thought, so I pretended to agree and promised that I would only read books in this room. Then she left.
        4. After carefully detecting her footsteps, I quickly logged in the computer and opened the game. The loading sign is running.
        5. Just as I got excited for the game was about to show up, the next second the speaker abruptly started to play very loud music. It sounded so sharp in the silence of the house in a warm, lazy time of the day. I knew this risky trial failed, and the upcoming result will be a sad story to a little game lover.
