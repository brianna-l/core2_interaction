            <p class="block" id="blockone">Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room.</p>
            <p class="block" id="blocktwo">The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light.</p>
            <p class="block" id="blockthree">We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose.</p>
            <p class="block" id="blockfour">We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glows of fading rays clinging to the surface of dusty walls, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color.</p>
