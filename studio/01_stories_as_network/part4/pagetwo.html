        <p class="two" id="two1">And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this <i>small corner</i> of the atmosphere ther reigns complete and <i>utter silence</i>; that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway.<br><br>And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a <b>variation</b> of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows - it has nothing else.</p>
        <div class="middleline"></div>
        <p class="two" id="two2">The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.<br><br>The <b>hue</b> may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so light; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the <i>mood</i> of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.</p>
