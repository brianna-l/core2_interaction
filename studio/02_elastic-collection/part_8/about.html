        <p>This project is a collection of photos that capture two spaces: outside vs inside. Ranging from 2024 January to March, these photos originated in two locations. The first collection I took is at Dali, China, and the second half is in New York, U.S. The inside space presents as another world in my perspective. In the form of an Art gallery, they are highlighted through turning each into a painting-like object. Within each individual page, you can see 4 froms of the photograph to experience shifting back and forth between two worlds.</p>
